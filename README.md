This are some guidelines we came up at Geniux when dealing with code. It is heavily based on the [contributing guideline of Github's Atom editor](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) with some minor changes (mostly in the emoji section with adding emojis for Bitbucket where there are no Github equivalents).

## Git Commit Messages
- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally

Consider starting the commit message with an applicable emoji:
- :art: when improving the format/structure of the code
- :racehorse: when improving performance
- :non-potable_water: when plugging memory leaks (Bitbucket :underage:)
- :memo: when writing docs
- :penguin: when fixing something on Linux
- :apple: when fixing something on Mac OS
- :checkered_flag: when fixing something on Windows (Bitbucket :guardsman:)
- :bug: when fixing a bug
- :fire: when removing code or files
- :green_heart: when fixing the CI build (Bitbucket :heartpulse:)
- :white_check_mark: when adding tests (Bitbucket :ok:)
- :lock: when dealing with security
- :arrow_up: when upgrading dependencies (Bitbucket :up:)
- :arrow_down: when downgrading dependencies (Bitbucket :thumsdown:)
- :shirt: when removing linter warnings
- :boar: when updating task runner
- :ship: Deployment
